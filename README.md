Estimating public debt using simple linear regression.

This aims to find out which instrument contributes to Kenya's public debt; in this scenario, I carry out simple linear regression by estimating how Treasury Bills affect the nation's public debt.

I find out that for every TBill issued, the public debt increases by 2.9.
